A robust, feature-rich student management system built entirely from scratch in C. This project demonstrates advanced memory management, data structures, and file handling techniques while providing an intuitive user interface for managing student records.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Add Students** - Dynamic memory allocation for any number of students
- **Display Records** - Beautiful formatted output with all student details
- **Search Functionality** - Find students instantly by unique ID
- **Update Records** - Modify any student information on-the-fly
- **Delete Records** - Safe removal with memory reallocation
- **Grade Management** - Automatic average calculation and pass/fail determination

### 🔧 Technical Highlights
- **Dynamic Memory Management** - Uses `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()` for optimal memory usage
- **Input Validation** - Prevents duplicate student IDs and invalid inputs
- **Modular Design** - Clean separation of concerns with header files
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error checking for memory operations
- **Cross-platform Compatibility** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler (version 4.0+)
- Make utility (optional)
- Any C IDE or text editor

### Installation & Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system-c.git
cd student-management-system-c

# Compile with GCC
gcc main.c Students.c -o student_system

# Run the program
./student_system
```

### Build with Code::Blocks
1. Open `Student_managment_system.cbp` in Code::Blocks
2. Press F9 to build and run
3. The executable will be created in `bin/Debug/`

## 📊 System Architecture

### Data Structure
```c
typedef struct Student {
    u8 name[50];      // Student name
    u16 ID;          // Unique identifier
    f32 grades[5];   // Array for 5 subject grades
    f32 avg;         // Calculated average
    u8 status[10];   // "Pass" or "Fail"
} Student;
```

### Memory Management Flow
```
User Input → Dynamic Allocation → Data Processing → Memory Cleanup
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
   Validation   malloc()          Calculations    free()
```

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Main Menu Options
```
1. Add a Student
   - Enter student details
   - System automatically calculates average and status
   
2. Display All Students
   - Shows formatted table with all records
   
3. Search Student
   - Find by ID with instant results
   
4. Update Record
   - Modify any field safely
   
5. Delete Record
   - Remove with automatic memory cleanup
   
6. Exit
   - Safely frees all allocated memory
```

### Example Session
```
=== Student Management System ===
1. Add a Student
2. Display All Students
3. Search for a Student
4. Update a Student's Record
5. Delete a Student's Record
6. Exit

Choose your option: 1
Enter details of a new student
How many students do you want to enter? 2
Please enter the name of student 1: Alice
Please enter the ID of student 1: 1001
Please enter grades for 5 subjects: 85 90 78 92 88
```

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### Memory Management
```c
// Dynamic allocation based on user input
*ptr = (Student *)malloc(no_students * sizeof(Student));

// Safe reallocation when deleting records
*ptr = realloc(*ptr, no_students * sizeof(Student));
```

### Grade Calculation Algorithm
```c
// Automatic average calculation
sum = 0;
for(j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    sum += grades[j];
}
avg = sum / 5.0;

// Pass/Fail determination
status = (avg >= 50.0) ? "Pass" : "Fail";
```

### Input Validation System
- **Duplicate ID Prevention**: Checks existing IDs before accepting new ones
- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Uses safe string functions
- **Memory Allocation Checks**: Validates malloc/realloc success

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases Covered
- ✅ Adding multiple students
- ✅ Duplicate ID rejection
- ✅ Grade calculation accuracy
- ✅ Memory leak prevention
- ✅ Edge case handling (empty records)
- ✅ Update operations integrity
- ✅ Delete operations with memory cleanup

### Performance Metrics
- **Memory Usage**: O(n) where n = number of students
- **Search Time**: O(n) linear search (optimized for small datasets)
- **Memory Leaks**: 0% (verified with Valgrind)

## 📝 Code Quality

### Standards Followed
- **C99 Standard** - Modern C features
- **Clean Code Principles** - Readable and maintainable
- **SOLID Principles** - Single responsibility for each function
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error checking

### Documentation
- **Inline Comments** - Every function documented
- **README** - Complete usage guide
- **Code Structure** - Logical file organization

## 🔄 Future Enhancements
